By offering sanitization, detection of harmful language, prevention of data leakage, and resistance against prompt
injection attacks, LLM-Guard ensures that your interactions with LLMs remain safe and secure.

## Installation

Begin your journey with LLM Guard by downloading the package:

```sh
pip install llm-guard
```

## Getting Started

**Important Notes**:

- LLM Guard is designed for easy integration and deployment in production environments. While it's ready to use
  out-of-the-box, please be informed that we're constantly improving and updating the repository.
- Base functionality requires a limited number of libraries. As you explore more advanced features, necessary libraries
  will be automatically installed.
- Ensure you're using Python version 3.9 or higher. Confirm with: `python --version`.
- Library installation issues? Consider upgrading pip: `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`.

**Examples**:

- Get started with [ChatGPT and LLM Guard](https://github.com/laiyer-ai/llm-guard/blob/main/examples/openai_api.py).

## Roadmap

### General

- [ ] Extend language support to cover popular and emerging languages, prioritize based on community feedback.
- [ ] Allow comparison of multiple outputs to facilitate better analysis and choice.
- [ ] Enable scanning of logits to support streaming mode.
- [ ] Expand examples and integrations, ensuring they cover common use-cases and are easy to follow.

### Prompt Scanners

- [ ] Utilize expressions for code detection to reduce dependency on models, improving speed and reliability.
- [ ] Support a variety of token calculators to offer more flexibility and compatibility.

### Output Scanners

- [ ] Scan for vulnerable libraries and provide recommendations for safer alternatives.
- [ ] Check for license compliance to ensure legal integrity.
- [ ] Detect insecure code patterns.
- [ ] Identify potential SQL injection points to enhance security.
- [ ] Verify links and provide options for whitelisting or blacklisting to maintain the quality of references.
